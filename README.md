# MNIST-Digits-classification-PCA-SVM

## Overview
As in today’s digital world optical character recognition technologies, use of auto-matic system for character recognition in physical document has increased. Andmany of the technologies are insufﬁcient for recognition and classify them correctlydue to different styles and handwritings. The main aim of a paper is to provide imple-mentation of classiﬁcation algorithms to recognize handwritten digits, i.e., 0–9. Thescope includes the elementary study of combination methods of different classiﬁersand calculates their performance on the basis of problem of handwritten digit recog-nition. Here, we are implementing PCA and SVM to recognize handwritten digit. This method able to reach accuracy rate of <b>92.71 %</b>.

## Tutorial Task
_ Analyze data and visualize images, plot drawing.

_ Doing PCA on this dataset, choose your own number of features in new M-dimensional vector space.

_ Doing a classification task using SVM on MNIST data. Divide the dataset into two parts: training set (70%) and test set (30%).

_ Make an evaluation of the model's effectiveness.
